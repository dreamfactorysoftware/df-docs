# Creating File System APIs

This chapter shows you how to quickly create REST APIs for SFTP, AWS S3, and more using the DreamFactory platform.

DreamFactory provides easy-to-use connectors for various file systems, allowing you to create RESTful APIs for file management operations without writing any code. These APIs can perform standard tasks such as:

* Creating, listing, updating, and deleting folders
* Creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting files
* Converting file formats (such as Excel to JSON)

In this section, you'll learn how to create APIs for:

* [SFTP File Servers](creating-an-sftp-rest-api.md)
* [AWS S3](creating-an-aws-s3-rest-api.md)
* [Converting Excel Files to JSON](converting-excel-to-json.md)

Each tutorial walks you through the configuration process and provides examples of common operations you can perform with these APIs.
