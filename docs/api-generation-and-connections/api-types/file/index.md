# File System APIs

This chapter shows you how to quickly create and use DreamFactory's REST APIs for SFTP, AWS S3, and more file services using the DreamFactory platform.

DreamFactory provides easy-to-use connectors for various file systems, allowing you to create RESTful APIs for file management operations without writing any code. These APIs can perform standard tasks such as:

* Creating, listing, updating, and deleting folders
* Creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting files
* Converting file formats (such as Excel to JSON)

In this section, you'll learn how to create APIs for:

* [SFTP File Servers](creating-an-sftp-rest-api)
* [AWS S3](creating-an-aws-s3-rest-api)
* [Converting Excel Files to JSON](converting-excel-to-json)

Each tutorial walks you through the configuration process and provides examples of common operations you can perform with these APIs.
