One of DreamFactory's most popular features is the wide-ranging authentication support. While API Key-based authentication will suffice for many DreamFactory-powered applications, developers often require a higher degree of security through user-specific authentication. In some cases Basic HTTP authentication will get the job done, however many enterprises require more sophisticated and flexible approaches largely because of the growing adoption of Single Sign On (SSO)-based solutions such as Active Directory and LDAP, and use of third-party identity providers and solutions such as [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), and [Okta](https://www.okta.com/).

You'll be pleased to know DreamFactory supports all of these options through a comprehensive set of authentication connectors. These connectors include Active Directory, LDAP, OAuth through well-known identity providers such as Facebook, GitHub, and Twitter, OpenID Connect, and SAML 2.0. In this chapter we'll walk you through all of the different authentication integration options at your disposal!

## Authentication Fundamentals

All DreamFactory APIs are private by default, requiring at minimum an API key for authentication purposes. The API key is associated with a role-based access control (RBAC) which determines what actions the client responsible for supplying the API key can undertake with regards to the API. For instance, it's possible to create a read-only RBAC which ensures the client can't access the API's insertion, modification, or deletion endpoints if they exist. If you're interested in protecting a database-backed API, you could limit access to a specific table, view, or stored procedure.

Further, DreamFactory supports both anonymous and user-based authentication. The former pertains to the provision of solely an API key, meaning DreamFactory won't possess any additional information regarding the user responsible for issuing API calls through the client. However in many cases you'll want to identify the connecting user by requiring authentication via an authentication provider such as Active Directory, LDAP, or Okta. In fact, DreamFactory supports these providers and more, including:

* Basic Authentication
* Active Directory
* LDAP
* OpenID Connect
* OAuth, including support for providers such as Facebook and GitHub
* SAML 2.0

### The Authentication Process

Regardless of whether the desired authentication approach is anonymous or user-based, you'll always supply an API key. This API key is passed along with the request via the `X-DreamFactory-Api-Key` header. DreamFactory will confirm the key exists (all API keys are listed under the web UIs `API Keys` tab), and then review the associated RBAC to confirm the request method and URI are permissible according to the RBAC definition.

When user-based authentication is used, DreamFactory will additionally expect a JSON Web Token (JWT) be passed along via the `X-DreamFactory-Session-Token` header. This JWT is generated by DreamFactory following a successful authentication against the authentication service provider. The following diagram outlines the authentication flow when using a third-party authentication provider such as Active Directory:

<img src="/img/authentication-apis/authentication-process.png" alt="DreamFactory Authentication Phase" />

Once successfully authenticated, DreamFactory will generate the JWT and return it to the client. This JWT should then be submitted along with each subsequent request. DreamFactory will check the token's validity and signature, examine the associated user's assigned RBAC (role-based access controls can be assigned on a per user-basis via the user's `Roles` tab), and if everything checks out the API call will be processed. The following diagram outlines this process:

### Oauth

DreamFactory currently supports many Oauth providers (Facebook Oauth, Google Oauth, GitHub Oauth and more). The menu for selecting and configuring Oauth services can be found in `Security > Authentication > Service Type`. The basics for configuring all the Oauth providers in DreamFactory are roughly the same. In this image we can see the common fields shared across the Oauth setup page.

<img src="/img/authentication-apis/oauth-setup.png" alt="Oauth setup screen" />

Below is a description of each field in the OAuth setup form:

| **Field**        | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **Namespace**    | A required field defined by the user; must end with `_oauth` (e.g., `google_oauth`). |
| **Label**        | The display name for the service. |
| **Description**  | A brief description of the service if desired. |
| **Default Role** | The role that will be applied by default to an authenticated user. Roles are configured in `API Generation & Connections > Role based Access`. |
| **Client ID**    | A required field using a public string used by the service to identify your app. |
| **Client Secret**| A required field using a private string used by the service to authenticate the identity of the application. |
| **Redirect URL** | A required field that redirects the user to the specified URL on successful login. |
| **Icon Class**   | The icon to be displayed for this service. |
| **Role per App** | This is a selector for giving users authenticating with the OAuth service access to specific services within the DreamFactory app. |

If a specific OAuth provider requires additional fields, those will be included in that provider's service menu. For example, Azure AD OAuth requires a `Tenant ID` and a `Resource` field.

### Active Directory

Assuming you already have an Active Directory service configured, configuring AD's use in DreamFactory is straight forward. Navigate to `Security > Authentication` and select Active Directory as the service. You will need to provide a `Namespace` that will be included in the URL structure for the request. Additionally you will need to provide the AD `Host` and the `Base DN`. You can provide an AD Admin Username and Password to access additional configuration in DreamFactory's UI for the AD authentication service, but it is not a requirement. You will also want to choose a `Default Role` for users authenticating via AD. Make sure that the `Active` slider is enabled with a checkmark and save. Users should be able to authenticate with their AD credentials from the WEB UI login page.

### Standard LDAP

Setting up Standard LDAP is pretty basic requiring only a couple of fields to function. You will need to provide a `Namespace`, `Default Role` for authenticated users, the LDAP `host`, and the `Base DN`. Ensure that the `Active` slider has a checkmark and save. LDAP authentication should be functioning at this point.
