# API Keys

## Creating an API Key

Next let's create an API Key, done by clicking on the `API Keys` tab located on the left navbar:

Click the purple + button to create a new key. You'll be presented with the following form:

<img src="/img/database-backed-api/api-key-overview.png" width="800" alt="App Configuration Form" />

Let's walk through each form field:

* **Application Name** and **Description**: The application name and description are used purely for human consumption, so feel free to complete these as you see fit.
* **Active**: This checkbox can be used to toggle availability of the API key, which will be generated and presented to you when the application is saved.
* **App Location**: This field presents four options for specifying the application's location. The overwhelming majority of users will choose `No Storage Required` because the API key will be used in conjunction with a mobile or web application, or via a server-side script.
* **Assign a Default Role**: It is here where you'll assign the newly created role to your application. Click on this select box and choose the role.

Click the `Save` button and the new API key will be generated.
