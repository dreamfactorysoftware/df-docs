# API Keys

## Creating an API Key

Next let's create an API Key, on the left navbar select **API Keys**:

Click the purple + button to create a new key. You are presented with the following form:

Let's walk through each field:

* **Application Name** and **Description**: The application name and description are used purely for human consumption, so feel free to complete these as you see fit.
* **Active**: This checkbox can be used to toggle availability of the API key, which is generated and presented to you when the application is saved.
* **App Location**: This field presents four options for specifying the application's location. The majority of users choose `No Storage Required` because the API key will be used in conjunction with a mobile or web application, or via a server-side script.
* **Assign a Default Role**: Use this field to assign the newly created role to your application. Click on the select box and choose the role.

Click **Save** button and the new API key is generated.
