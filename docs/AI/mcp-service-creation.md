# Creating an MCP Server Service

## Quick Reference

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Service Type** | MCP Server |
| **Required Fields** | API Name, Database Service |
| **Auto-Generated** | OAuth Client ID, OAuth Client Secret |
| **Authentication** | OAuth 2.0 |
| **Supported AI Clients** | ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, any MCP-compatible client |

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that enables AI assistants and development tools to interact with your DreamFactory database services through a consistent interface. Despite the growing popularity of direct API integrations, MCP-based connections remain an essential part of modern development workflows, allowing AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor to seamlessly query and manipulate your database resources.

But incorporating MCP functionality into your development environment can be challenging. Fortunately, you can use DreamFactory to easily create a full-featured MCP server that exposes your database services through the Model Context Protocol. This server can perform all of the standard database operations, including:

- Exploring database schemas, tables, and relationships
- Querying and filtering table data with advanced options
- Creating, updating, and deleting records
- Calling stored procedures and functions
- Managing database resources

In this tutorial we'll show you how to configure DreamFactory's MCP server service, and then walk through several usage examples.

## Generating the MCP Server and Companion Documentation

To create an MCP Server service, log in to your DreamFactory instance using an administrator account, select the **AI** tab, and then click the purple plus button to create a new connection:

![ai api creation](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/ai-api-creation.png)

MCP Server Service is currently the only available selection. More AI connectors are on the way, so stay tuned for upcoming additions.

![ai api selection](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/mcp-service-selection.png)

You'll be prompted to supply an **API name**, **label**, and **description**. Keep in mind the name must be lowercase and alphanumeric, as it will be used as the namespace within your generated API URI structure. The label and description are used for reference purposes within the administration console so you're free to title these as you please:

![mcp service_config](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/mcp-service-config.png)

Next, you'll scroll down to the **Advanced options** section. There you'll need to supply the following details. There are only 2 required fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **API Name** | Select the DreamFactory database service that you want to expose through MCP. This must be an existing database service configured in your DreamFactory instance. The dropdown will show all available database services. |
| **OAuth Client ID** | The OAuth Client ID is generated by Dreamfactory for you. This is the field that MCP Server users are going to provide to MCP client during connection creation. |
| **OAuth Client Secret** | The OAuth Client Secret is also generated by Dreamfactory for you. This is the field that MCP Server users are going to provide to MCP client during connection creation. |
| **Custom Login URL** | Optional Field that you could use in order to have a custom MCP login page. DreamFactory's login page would be used if nothing is provided in this field. [How to configure?](../AI/mcp-custom-login-page)|

The **API Name** field is a dropdown that lists all available database services in your DreamFactory instance. Simply select the database service you want to expose through MCP. This service must already be configured in DreamFactory before you can select it.

After saving your changes, head over to the **API Docs** tab to review the generated documentation. You'll be presented with information about the MCP endpoint by running the GET request:

![mcp service_docs](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/mcp-service-docs.png)

The **mcp_endpoint** field is what you should use for your AI Agents:
![mcp service_details](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/mcp-service-details.png)

## Example Of Usage

First of all you should get your **mcp_endpoint** that we will use in our Agent.

### ChatGPT
To connect your MCP server with ChatGPT:

1. Make sure Developer Mode is enabled in ChatGPT.
2. Create a new application by navigating to:
   Settings -> Apps -> Advanced Settings -> Create app
![mcp-example-creation](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/mcp-example-creation.png)

3. Set authentication to OAuth, use mcp_endpoint, OAuth Client ID, and OAuth Client Secret in your Agent configuration.
![mcp-example-app](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/mcp-example-app.png)

After creating the application, you can attach it to your chat and use its tools. For example, to show the database tables:
1. Attach your newly created application to the chat.
![mcp-example-connect](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/mcp-example-connect.png)
2. Use the Agent commands to query the MCP server. For example:
```
Show me tables in my database/list tables
```
![mcp-example-list](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/mcp-example-list.png)

The Agent will connect to the MCP server using the mcp_endpoint and return the available database tables, allowing you to interact with your data directly from ChatGPT.

### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop supports remote MCP servers with OAuth authentication through its **Connectors** feature. DreamFactory fully supports Claude's Dynamic Client Registration (DCR), making setup straightforward — no manual OAuth credential entry is required.

**Requirements:**
- Claude Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise subscription
- Claude Desktop application (v1.5+) installed
- Your DreamFactory MCP endpoint URL (found in the API Docs tab after creating your MCP service)

#### Step 1: Create Your MCP Service in DreamFactory

First, ensure you have an MCP service configured in DreamFactory. Navigate to the **AI** tab in the DreamFactory admin to see your existing MCP services:

![DreamFactory AI Services List](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/df-ai-services-list.png)

To create a new MCP service, click the purple **+** button. Select **MCP Server Service** as the service type:

![Service Type Selection](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/df-service-type-dropdown.png)

Fill in the service details — **Namespace** (used in the endpoint URL), **Label**, and **Description**. Under **Advanced Options**, select the database service to expose via the **API Name** dropdown. The **OAuth Client ID** and **OAuth Client Secret** are auto-generated:

![MCP Service Configuration](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/df-mcp-service-create-filled.png)

Click **Save** to create your MCP service. You can review the configuration at any time by clicking on the service in the AI list:

![MCP Service Detail View](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/df-mcp-service-config-detail.png)

#### Step 2: Get Your MCP Endpoint URL

After saving, go to the **API Docs** tab and run the GET request to find your `mcp_endpoint`. It will look like:

```
https://your-dreamfactory-instance.com/mcp/your-service-name
```

#### Step 3: Connect Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop and go to **Settings > Connectors**.

2. Click **Add Connector** and paste your DreamFactory MCP endpoint URL.

3. Click **Connect**. Claude will automatically:
   - Discover the OAuth authorization and token endpoints
   - Register itself as an OAuth client via Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)
   - Open a browser window for you to log in to DreamFactory

4. Log in with your DreamFactory credentials. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected back to Claude Desktop.

5. Your connector is now active. You can start using natural language to interact with your database:
   ```
   Show me all tables in the database
   List the first 10 records from the customers table
   ```

:::tip
Claude Desktop handles OAuth automatically through DCR — you do **not** need to manually enter the Client ID or Client Secret. Just provide the MCP endpoint URL and Claude takes care of the rest.
:::

**Troubleshooting:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Redirect URI not registered"** | Ensure your DreamFactory instance is accessible over HTTPS. Claude uses `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback` as its redirect URI, which is automatically registered during DCR. |
| **Connection timeout** | Verify your DreamFactory instance is publicly accessible or that Claude can reach it through your network configuration. |
| **Authentication failed** | Check that your DreamFactory user account has appropriate permissions to access the database service exposed through MCP. |
| **"Client registration failed"** | Ensure the MCP service is active (green toggle) in the DreamFactory AI tab and that the server supports the DCR endpoint at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`. |

### Cursor

Cursor IDE supports MCP servers for AI-assisted development. Unlike Claude Desktop, Cursor requires manual OAuth credential configuration.

**Setup Steps:**

1. Open Cursor Settings and navigate to the **MCP** configuration section (under **Features**).

2. Click **Add new MCP server** and select **SSE** as the transport type.

3. Enter your DreamFactory MCP endpoint URL in the **Server URL** field:
   ```
   https://your-dreamfactory-instance.com/mcp/your-service-name
   ```

4. Configure OAuth credentials from your DreamFactory MCP service's **Advanced Options**:
   - **Client ID**: Copy from the **OAuth Client ID** field in DreamFactory
   - **Client Secret**: Copy from the **OAuth Client Secret** field in DreamFactory

   You can find these values in the DreamFactory admin under **AI > your MCP service > Advanced Options**:

   ![MCP OAuth Credentials](/img/api-generation-and-connections/api-types/utility/creating-mcp-server/df-mcp-service-config-detail.png)

5. Save and connect. Cursor will prompt you to authenticate via your DreamFactory login page.

6. Once connected, you can use Cursor's AI features to query and manipulate your database directly from the IDE.
