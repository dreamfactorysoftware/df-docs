# DreamFactory Documentation

> DreamFactory is an open-source REST API platform that automatically generates secure, scalable APIs for hundreds of data sources including databases, file systems, and third-party services. This documentation covers installation, configuration, API generation, authentication, security, and administration.

DreamFactory enables developers to instantly create REST APIs from databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MongoDB), file systems (AWS S3, SFTP), and integrate with third-party APIs. The platform provides comprehensive authentication support including OAuth, SAML, LDAP, Active Directory, and role-based access control. Built with PHP/Laravel, it offers both on-premise and cloud deployment options with Docker, Kubernetes, and traditional server installations.

Key features include automatic API documentation generation, real-time API testing, event scripting, caching, rate limiting, and extensive security controls. The platform is designed for enterprise use across healthcare, finance, telecommunications, and government sectors.
