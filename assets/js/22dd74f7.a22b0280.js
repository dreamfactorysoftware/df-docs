By embracing this automated approach, development teams can shave weeks if not months off the development cycle, and in doing so greatly reduce the likelihood of bugs or security issues due to mishaps such as SQL injection. This approach doesn\'t come with any trade offs either, because DreamFactory\'s database-backed APIs are fully-featured REST interfaces. They offer comprehensive CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) capabilities, endpoints for executing stored procedures, and even endpoints for managing the schema.","sidebar":"intro"},"API Creation and Management/interacting-with-api":{"id":"API Creation and Management/interacting-with-api","title":"Interacting with the API","description":"The following topic contains examples to help you become familiar with the many ways you can interact with a database-backed API. For these examples we\'re using the Insomnia HTTP client, however you can use any similar client or even cURL to achieve the same results.","sidebar":"intro"},"DreamFactory Configuration/configuration":{"id":"DreamFactory Configuration/configuration","title":"Basic Configuration","description":"This page outlines the basic configuration settings for DreamFactory.
